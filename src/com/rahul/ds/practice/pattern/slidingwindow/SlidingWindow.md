#Sliding Window pattern

##Imagine you have a line of items, and you want to find a group of items 
within this line that meets a certain condition, like the largest or smallest group 
with that condition. The sliding window technique is like having two markers, 
one at the beginning and one at the end of this line. You adjust these markers 
to create a 'window' that covers a part of the line. The goal is to find the best 
window that satisfies the condition you're looking for. To do this, you might move 
the markers to expand or shrink the window until you find the optimal group of items.
