# Data-Structure-And-Algo
This repository contains various DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problems. For each problem, a corresponding README file has been added to provide information about the specific problem we are addressing.

Currently, the repository includes problems related to arrays and singly linked lists. I continue to add problems and their solutions as I make progress.


Happy Coding !!!
